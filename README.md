# MASQ web3 dApp Library Public Repository

## Vision
MASQ stands to be the only truly decentralized-stack web3 privacy browser, powered by a community of supporters. To provide a fully fledged user experience to both web2 users transitioning into web3, and those native to web3, the MASQ contributors must foster and embrace an ecosystem of web3 builders, projects and partners. **Our vision at MASQ is to onboard and grow a rich ecosystem of the most innovative, user friendly and fundamental web3 partners and dApps to offer one-click discover and experience to the MASQ users of the world**

## Purpose
Bundled into the MASQ web3 browser, there is a dedicated **web3 Store**

This is a Library containing many popular web3-founded and blockchain based platforms, dApps and websites. Also included are other popular websites that many users interact with on a daily basis, to make navigating and interacting with these seamless.

To keep this directory updated and dynamic, this repository will be maintained by the MASQ team and further curated jointly by the community and greater web3 ecosystem using several methods. _They will be outlined as they become part of the process._

### For web3 projects and platforms
You are encouraged to reach out to our [team at MASQ](mailto:info@masq.ai?subject=Would%love%to%be%added%to%the%web3%Store!) to be included in this highly visible directory, so thousands of users around the world have one-click access to your platform and technology.

### For Community recommendations
**Discord**

There is a dedicated #web3-dapps-request [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/4hCEs3hPhb) for dApp and project discussions

**Canny dApp Request**

On our MASQ team Canny page there is a [dApps board](https://masq-network.canny.io/dapps) where you can request your favourite dApps to be added and upvote them to encourage their addition.

**Make sure you tweet your recommendation and tag [@MASQ_ai](https://twitter.com/MASQ_ai) with hashtag #masqweb3store to get the team's attention faster!**

## Guidelines
The team at MASQ will be releasing guidelines shortly for projects and communities to engage in getting included in the directory, as well as criteria for applying and being approved.
